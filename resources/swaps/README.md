# Swaps

## What kind of swap should I be using?

In most cases, you'll want to use **Batch Swaps**. The only time you would want to use a Single Swap is when you're making a trade between just two tokens in one pool. **Executing multiple Single Swaps in a single transaction is inefficient and should instead be batched**.&#x20;
